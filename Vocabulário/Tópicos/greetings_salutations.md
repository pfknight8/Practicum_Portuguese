# Saudações e Cumprimentos

Greetings and Salutations. A bit of a redundant expression, given the same meaning, but appropriate given our topic of the many ways one can greet another in Portuguese.

| Português      | English                | Notes |
|:---------------|:-----------------------|:------|
| Olá            | Hello                  | Like the spanish "Hola" |
| Alô            | Hello                  | Used specifically when answering the phone |
| Oi             | Hi                     | An informal "hi" more popular in Brazil |
| Bom dia        | Good morining/day      |       |
| Boa tarde      | Good afternoon         |       |
| Boa noite      | Good evening/night     | Unlike Italian/English, this can be either a greeting or a farewell |
| Muito prazer   | Pleased to meet you    |       |
| Tudo bem?      | All good?/How are you? |       |
| Como vai?      | How's it going?        |       |
| E aí?          | What's up?             | Very informal, mostly in Brazil |

For all of these, watch out for pronunciation differences for Portugal vs Brazil

## Despedidas e Demissões

Farewells and dismissals. Obviously being tounge-in-check with this title, but the premise is still valid. We know from the above how to say hello, so naturally we now need to know how to say goodbye.
