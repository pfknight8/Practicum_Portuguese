# Construction of Possesives

Used to denote things that belong to others.  This includes both possesive determiners--my, your, their, etc--and pronouns--mine, yours, theirs, etc.

Portuguese follows a similar pattern to Italian, for those familiar with it. Both determiners and pronouns will use the same word, requiring a matching of the gender and number of the noun being possessed.

Possessive determiners usually will require the definite article before the word, such as in "A minha tia" = "My aunt." Pronouns usually do not, unless they start a sentance.

But this is somewhat looser in Portuguese than it is in Italian. In Portuguese, the definite article is often dropped, particularly if the emphasis is on the point of possession itself--this is MY desk!--or if there is no special emphasis. Sometimes the inclusion of the article is used to emphasis the specificity of the object from a group--THIS ONE is mine. This is different than in Italian, where the article was only dropped for close relations, such as "mia madre," or some other close relation.
