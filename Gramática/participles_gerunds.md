# Participls and Gerunds

Participles and Gerunds are other forms that verbs can take, but are not a verb mood/tense in and of themselves. They are often used in forming verb tenses, such as the pretérito perfeito composto, but can also be used to convert a verb into use as adjectives, pronouns, verbs in dependant clauses, and other uses such as will be discussed here.

These are nominal verb forms, in that they do not indicate verb tense, mood, or person on their own. They share this trait with the infinitive form.

## The Present Participle/Gerund

In Portuguese, *Gerúndio / Particípio Presente*, are not distunguished in the same way as with other languages.

This is typically considered to be the equivalent of the English "-ing" form of a verb. Because 

Interestingly enough, there are two ways that these are formed, with one being favored in Brazil and the other in Portugal. Both would be understandable in either, but just know this for cultural reasons.

The 'European' preference is to use "a + infinitive." This is easy enough, since there is no worrying about irregular forms. So "a trabalhar" means "working," "a escrever" means "writing," and so on.

The other way, which is more popular in Brazil, is to use the gerund/present participle form, which generally involves adding an '-ndo' ending on the verb (dropping the '-r'). For example, "trabalhando" means "working," "escrevendo" means "writing," and so on.

Unlike in English (or Italian), these are *NEVER* used as an adjective or noun in Portuguese. (That is technically done with "de + infinitive"). Instead, these only serve to create progressive tenses. As such, there really is no present participle in portuguese, then, as these are left with the gerund functions.

### Adverbial Gerund

Used in dependent clauses: not to be confused with gerund phrases, as these don't exist in Portuguese.

Causality: can appear in clauses indicating the cause of the main action. Here it will appear at the beginning of a sentance, and can replace the use of porque (because), como (as/since/like), dado que (since), etc.
"Estando com febre, eu faltar ao trabalho." = "Because I had a fever, I was absent from work.""

Consequence: related to causality, can appear in the clause describing the consequence of the main action, so naturally will come at the end of a sentance. Rare, but able to replace pelo que (therefore), de modo que (in such a way that/so that), etc.
"Perdi minha carteira, sendo impossível pagar!" = "I lost my wallet, making it impossible to pay!"

Condition: replacing se (if) and caso (supposing/in case) to express conditions, one can use a gerund, typically at the start of a sentence.
"Ficando sozinhos,..." = "Staying alone,..."

Concessions: replacing conjunctions like embora (although) and apesar de (even though/despite), but often used in conjunction with mesmo (eves/indeed/despite).
"Mesmo estudando todos os dias, tirei má nota no teste" = "Despite studying every day, I got a bad grade on the test."

Manner: can be used to characterize the manner in which the main action was done.
"Ela foi até casa, caminhando pelo parque." = "She went home, walking through the park."

Time: can convey temporal relations in place of conjuctions such as depois (after/later), a seguir (subsequently/following), etc
"Jerry soltou um grito, batendo o dedão do pé." = "Jerry let out a shout, (after) stubbing his toe"

### Replacing the Conjunction And (e)

In Portuguese, the gerund can be used to connect to coordinated clauses in place of 'and' ('e'). In this funtion, it can also take on the dual task of serving one of the adverbial functions listed above, particularily the time one.

For example:
"Você vai sair para jantar, dormindo eles em casa." = "You're going out to dinner, while they sleep at home."
instead of:
"Você vai sair para jantar e eles dormem em casa." = "You're going out to dinner, and they sleep at home."

### Ir + Gerúndio

The most common way gerunds are used in European Portuguese, this construction is used to expresses progress or gradualness. It expresses actions happening gradually or concurrently, with a sense of continuous progress, implying steady action. This is often synonymous with a simple present construction, but is often use to emphasis these meanings.

This is NOT to be confused with the simple future "ir + infinitive," which means "going to..."

Continuity:
"Os preços vão subindo" = "Prices keep going up"
"Ele estava passeando" = "He was strolling around"

Concurrent:
"Eu vou limpando a casa enquanto você vai preparando a comida." = "I (am) clean(ing) the house while you prepare the food."

Encouragement/Instruction:
"Vai comendo que eu já como." = "You can start eating, I'll eat later"

General State:
"Vai-se andando" = "It's just going/getting by"
