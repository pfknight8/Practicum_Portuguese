# O Alfabeto Português

On paper, the Portuguese alphabet looks identical to the English one, having the same base 26 letters. However, there are several accents and diacritical marks that may be added to letters, as well as digraphs, that are included to produce the different sounds of the language.

Unlike spanish and italian, and more like french and english, portuguese may have many pronunciations for a letter, and so is not as strict with its spelling rules. There may be more than one "correct" way to spell a word given the rules of the language, so factors such as etymology, morphology, or traditional influences go into why a word is spelled a certain way.

The names of the letters are masculine in terms of article gender.

### Digraphs

Portuguese uses digraphs--ie two letter pairs--to create some sounds that are differenc than the sum of what the letters would otherwise produce. Much like how the italian "gn" = "ñ" in spanish, these create unique sounds, but do not count as distinct entries in the alphabet or for collation purposes.

### Diacritical Marks

Portuguese uses 5 diacritical marks to modify letters. The '¸' cedilla (cedilha), '~' tilde (til), '´' acute (agudo), '`' grave (grave), 'ˆ' circumflex (circunflexo). Traditionally, the was a '¨' diaresis mark used, but this has been in disuse, officially abolished from the language worldwide as of 2009.

- Acute mark ´: Indicates stress and quality of the vowel, with acute marks generally being for low vowels. They can also be used to disguish homographs.
- Circumflex ˆ: Indicates stress and quality of the vowel, with circumflex marks generally being for high vowels. They can also be used to disguish homographs.
- Grave `: Used in contractions of two consecutive vowels (ie crasis)...
- Tilde ˜: Marks nasal vowels before glides...
- Cedilla ¸: In Portuguese, this is only used on the letter 'c' to become 'Ç' or 'ç' as a means to indicate the soft /s/ sound is to be used in pronounciation. In Portuguese, the pronunciation of 'c' follows the rule of /k/ when followed by an 'a' 'o' or 'u,' while it is /s/ if followed by a 'i' or 'e.' A common pattern in romance languages, so here this mark allows us to get a soft /s/ sound for words where an 'a' 'o,' or 'u' follow a 'c.'
