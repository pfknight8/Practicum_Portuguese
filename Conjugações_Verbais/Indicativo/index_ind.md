# The Indicative Mood

A realis mood, the indicative mood (Modo Indicativo) is used to express certainty, facts, and reality. Like with other languages, this is the most common mood, and is therefore the first that one will generally learn.

There are several tenses associated with this mood, which can be grouped into the present, past, and future. Like many romance languages, there are several tenses for each, used to convey different aspects of how to talk about them.
