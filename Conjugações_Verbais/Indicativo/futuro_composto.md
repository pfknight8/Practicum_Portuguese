# The Future Perfect Tense

Called the *Futuro do Presente Composto*, this tense is used to describe an action that will be completed before a specific point in the future. It is roughly like saying "(something) **will have** been done (by such a time)" in English. Often the adverb 'already'--'já' in Português--will be included for emphasis in sentances.

This tense also has a secondary use in Portuguese, to make assumptions. It can be used to express an educated guess or assumption about an action presumed to have happened in the past. For example, "O suspeito *terá entrado* pela janela." = "The suspect *must have entered* through the window." In this case, the "must have entered" could also translate to "presumably entered."
