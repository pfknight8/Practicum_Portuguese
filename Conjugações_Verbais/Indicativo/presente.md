# Present Indicative

The **Present Tense Indicative Mood** is typically the first conjugation that is taught in most languages. It does a lot of legwork, and can be useful for beginners in forming simple sentances that can get one's point across well enough. As an [indicative](./index_ind.md) mood, it is used to *indicate* things that are actually real/realizable or are happening presently, to state facts and opinions, and in asking questions.

## Standard Conjugations

Regular verbs will follow these simple patterns for changing their verb endings. This involves keeping the 'root' of the verb the same, dropping the ending, and then replacing it with the appropriate ending for the person and number which one wishes to refer to. Keep in mind that verbs that are regular in one tense/mood may not be so in all of the others.

## Irregular Conjugations

These are, as the name suggests, verbs that do not follow these regular patterns. In some cases, they are unique and simply have to be memorized, but fortunately many of these are verbs that fall into other patterns. Some of these are of a regular enough pattern to allow for developing an intuitive application, and as such can be thought of as "regular irregulars."

### *Ter*

Ter is a very important verb in Português, functioning similarily to how 'avere' works in Italian. It means 'to have,' and can be used directly in that sense--as in, "Eu tenho um casaco" = "I have a coat." However, it can also function as an auxiliary verb to form compound tenses, similar to Italian and English.

It has an irregular conjugation structure, as shown below.

| Verb       | Eu         | Tu         | Ele/Ela/Você | Noi        | Voi        | Eles/Elas/Vocês |
|:-----------|:----------:|:----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:---------------:|
| Ter        | tenho      | tens       | tem          | temos      | tendes     | têm             |

### *Haver*

Needs to be noted somewhere for its relation to ter, deprecation in Brazil vs Portugal, etc.
Modern usage is largely restricted to a few use cases, and mostly where formal language is used:
- as the impersonal verb (there is/are), as in "Há muitas pessoas na sala" = "There are many people in the room," although even this is being replaced by 'ter.'
- indicating time has passed: "há" is the preferred way to say "ago" or related phrases, such as "Não falo com ele há muito tempo" = "I haven't spoken with him for a long time."
- fixed expressions: set phrases, by tradition/history, that include it will continue to do so, such as "Haja paciência!" = "Give me patience!"

Also can used as an auxiliary verb for perfect tenses, but it has almost been completely replaced by 'ter' in modern Portuguese.

Generally, this verb is being replaced 'tem,' especially in Brazilian Portuguese, but it is good to know when you come across it, and you will be understood if you use it, you just may be percieved as being overly formal (or just a foreigner, obviously).

| Verb       | Eu         | Tu         | Ele/Ela/Você | Noi           | Voi         | Eles/Elas/Vocês |
|:-----------|:----------:|:----------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| Haver      | hei        | hás        | há           | havemos/hemos | haveis/heis | hão             |

### *Ser*

Another unique and important verb is *ser*, which means "to be." Very common in the language, for reasons that should be obvious. It is much more in line with its use in the Spanish language (also 'ser') than the Italian 'essere.' Ser is used in describing inherent/permanent qualities, identity, origin, and 'permanent' facts. It can also be used as an auxiliary verb, mostly to form the passive voice ("A casa é construída" = "The house is built").

| Verb       | Eu         | Tu         | Ele/Ela/Você | Noi        | Voi        | Eles/Elas/Vocês |
|:-----------|:----------:|:----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:---------------:|
| Ser        | sou        | és         | é            | somos      | sois       | são             |
